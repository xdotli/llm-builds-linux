I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore the codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see we're working in a git repository at `/Users/lixiangyi/conductor/workspaces/llm-builds-linux/victoria` on the `xdotli/build-examples` branch. The repository appears to be related to benchmarking (based on the recent commits mentioning \"benchflow-ai\" and \"benchmark framework\").\n\nI'm currently in READ-ONLY mode, which means I can:\n- Explore the codebase using tools like Glob, Grep, and Read\n- Use read-only bash commands (ls, cat, git log, find, etc.)\n- Design and plan implementations\n- Provide detailed architectural guidance\n\nI cannot and will not:\n- Create, modify, or delete any files\n- Run commands that change system state\n- Install packages or dependencies\n\nTo get started, could you please share:\n1. **The requirements** for what you'd like to implement or explore\n2. **Any specific perspective** you'd like me to apply during the design process (e.g., performance-focused, maintainability-focused, security-focused, etc.)\n\nOr if you'd like, I can first explore the current codebase structure to understand what we're working with.
