# Agent Trajectory Summary: Building Chromium

**PR:** https://github.com/benchflow-ai/llm-builds-linux/pull/1 (MERGED)

This document summarizes the complete trajectory of LLM agents building Chromium from source on macOS ARM64.

## Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total wall-clock time | ~6 hours |
| Agent active time | ~3 hours |
| Sessions | 2 |
| Human messages (build task) | 3 (1 initial + 2 follow-ups) |
| Human interventions | 1 critical (Xcode installation) |
| Final result | SUCCESS - Chromium.app built |
| **Total cost** | **$42.84** |
| Model | Claude Opus 4.5 |


## Cost & Token Usage

| Metric | Session 1 | Session 2 | Total |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Input tokens | 2,169 | 143 | 2,312 |
| Output tokens | 6,970 | 10,156 | 17,126 |
| Cache read tokens | 3,600,149 | 3,772,117 | 7,372,266 |
| Cache creation tokens | 297,132 | 1,327,373 | 1,624,505 |
| API calls | 91 | 111 | 202 |
| **Cost** | **$11.53** | **$31.31** | **$42.84** |

### Cost Breakdown by Token Type
- Input tokens: $0.03 (@ $15/M)
- Output tokens: $1.28 (@ $75/M)
- Cache read: $11.06 (@ $1.50/M)
- Cache creation: $30.46 (@ $18.75/M)

### Cost Efficiency Notes
- Most cost came from cache creation (71% of total)
- Session 2 was more expensive due to longer monitoring with many API calls
- Cache read was heavily utilized (7.4M tokens) keeping costs down
- Effective rate: ~$7/hour of agent active time

## Session 1: Setup and Source Fetch

**File:** `session1-setup-and-fetch.jsonl` (10.7 MB)
**Time:** 2025-12-15 ~3:41 PM - 5:02 PM EST
**Duration:** ~1.5 hours

### Step-by-Step Trajectory

#### 1. Branch Setup (3:41 PM)
- Agent renamed branch from `xdotli/shanghai` to `xdotli/build-chrome`
- Command: `git branch -m xdotli/build-chrome`

#### 2. Research Phase (3:41 - 3:42 PM)
- Web search: "Chromium browser build from source 2025 official guide"
- Web search: "Chromium build macOS M1 M2 ARM64 instructions depot_tools 2025"
- Fetched official docs from `chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/mac_build_instructions.md`
- Key findings:
  - Need Xcode with macOS SDK
  - Use depot_tools for build management
  - `fetch --no-history chromium` saves time
  - Build with `autoninja -C out/Default chrome`

#### 3. System Check (3:42 PM)
- Checked macOS version: 26.0 (Build 25A353)
- Checked architecture: ARM64 (Apple Silicon M2)
- Checked disk space: 199GB available
- Checked RAM: 32GB
- Checked existing tools: git, python3, xcode-select present
- **Issue identified:** Only Command Line Tools installed, not full Xcode

#### 4. depot_tools Setup (3:42 - 3:43 PM)
- Created todo list for tracking progress
- Cloned depot_tools:
  ```
  git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
  ```
- Verified clone successful (255 files)

#### 5. Source Fetch Started (3:43 PM)
- Created `chromium/` directory
- Started background fetch:
  ```
  cd chromium && fetch --no-history chromium
  ```
- Task ID: b268a3c
- This downloads ~35GB of source code

#### 6. Build Script Creation (3:43 - 3:44 PM)
- Created `build_chromium.sh` with:
  - PATH setup for depot_tools
  - gclient sync step
  - GN configuration generation
  - Build args (is_debug=false, is_component_build=true, symbol_level=0)
  - autoninja build command

#### 7. Monitoring Fetch Progress (3:44 - 3:49 PM)
- Periodically checked fetch status
- Observed gclient downloading dependencies
- Source growing in `chromium/src/`

#### 8. README Documentation (3:49 PM)
- Updated README.md with:
  - Experiment status
  - Steps completed
  - System requirements
  - Xcode blocker documented

#### 9. Xcode Blocker Hit (3:49 - 5:02 PM)
- Attempted to run `gn gen out/Default`
- Error: `xcode-select: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode`
- Agent documented the blocker
- Provided instructions for user to install Xcode
- Session ended waiting for human intervention

### Key Events - Session 1
- Successfully cloned depot_tools
- Successfully started 35GB source fetch
- Created build infrastructure (script, config)
- **Blocked by:** Xcode not installed (only Command Line Tools)


## Session 2: Build and Monitor

**File:** `session2-build-and-monitor.jsonl` (493 KB)
**Time:** 2025-12-15 ~6:56 PM - 9:32 PM EST
**Duration:** ~2.5 hours

### Step-by-Step Trajectory

#### 1. Context Recovery (6:56 PM)
- Read attached file (empty)
- Read `build_chromium.sh` to understand build setup
- Read `README.md` to understand current state

#### 2. Environment Check (6:56 - 6:57 PM)
- Checked Xcode: Now installed! (Version 26.2)
- Xcode path: `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`
- **Blocker resolved** by user between sessions

#### 3. Build State Discovery (6:57 PM)
- Found `chromium/src/out/Default/` directory exists
- Found Chromium.app bundle exists but incomplete (empty MacOS directory)
- **Key discovery:** Build process already running!
  - PID 16031
  - Started at 5:02 PM
  - Using siso/ninja build system

#### 4. Duplicate Build Attempt (6:58 PM)
- Attempted to run `autoninja -C out/Default chrome`
- Got "waiting for lock holder pid=16031" message
- Realized existing build was in progress
- Killed duplicate attempt (task ID: b1ebc60)

#### 5. Build Monitoring Setup (6:59 PM)
- Started background monitoring script
- Polling every 60 seconds
- Tracking:
  - Ninja log entry count (completed actions)
  - Build directory size
  - Process status

#### 6. Build Progress Tracking (6:59 PM - 9:09 PM)
Progress snapshots:
```
[19:00] Actions: 95,593  | Size: 4.9G
[19:30] Actions: 96,320  | Size: 5.0G
[20:00] Actions: 100,012 | Size: 5.2G

[21:00] Actions: 116,046 | Size: 6.1G
[21:09] Actions: 118,484 | Size: 6.6G (COMPLETE)
```

#### 7. Build Completion Detection (9:10 PM)
- Process 16031 exited
- Monitoring script detected completion
- Verified Chromium binary exists:
  ```
  /chromium/src/out/Default/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium
  ```

#### 8. Verification (9:10 - 9:11 PM)
- Confirmed binary file size: 34,384 bytes
- Confirmed total build output: 7.8GB
- Build status: SUCCESS

#### 9. Documentation Updates (9:11 - 9:32 PM)
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude:
  - `chromium/` (35GB source)
  - `depot_tools/` (build tools)
- Updated `README.md`:
  - Status changed to "BUILD SUCCESSFUL"
  - Added metrics table
  - Added reproduction steps
  - Added key learnings

#### 10. Trajectory Analysis (9:32 PM)
- Analyzed previous session from `~/.claude/projects/`
- Extracted key events and timeline
- Prepared summary for user

### Key Events - Session 2
- Discovered Xcode was installed (human intervention)
- Found build already in progress from Session 1
- Monitored 2-hour build to completion
- Verified successful Chromium.app binary
- Documented results and prepared for commit

## Observations for Agent Evaluation

### What Worked Well
1. **Research phase** - Agent found correct official documentation quickly
2. **Systematic approach** - Created todo list, followed steps methodically
3. **Background tasks** - Used background processes for long-running operations
4. **State recovery** - Session 2 successfully recovered context from Session 1
5. **Monitoring** - Agent polled build progress and detected completion

### What Required Human Help
1. **Xcode installation** - Agent cannot install macOS applications (critical blocker)
2. **sudo commands** - Agent noted but couldn't execute `xcode-select -s`
3. **Session continuation** - Human had to start Session 2 and say "continue"
4. **Progress check-ins** - Human asked "lmk when it's finished", "where is the source", etc.
5. **Documentation guidance** - Human directed what to commit and how to summarize

### Human Interaction Count (Build Task Only)
- **Session 1:** 1 message ("can you try building chrome for me")
- **Session 2:** 2 messages ("continue building chrome for me", "lmk when it's finished")
- **Total:** 3 human messages to complete the build

Note: Additional messages after build completion were for documentation/trajectory analysis, not part of the build task itself.

### Blockers Encountered
1. **Xcode vs Command Line Tools** - Chromium requires full Xcode
2. **Build lock** - Second build attempt blocked by first

### Complexity Metrics
- **Total tool calls:** ~200+
- **Web searches:** 2
- **Web fetches:** 1
- **File operations:** 50+
- **Bash commands:** 100+
- **Build actions compiled:** 118,484
