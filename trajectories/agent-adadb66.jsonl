I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore and plan implementations in this codebase.\n\nI can see we're in the `victoria` workspace, which appears to be related to Linux builds based on the git status showing:\n- Build directories for Alpine, BusyBox, kernel, and Yocto\n- A software directory\n- Recent commits about Linux distro benchmarks and builds\n\nI'm in **READ-ONLY mode** - I can explore the codebase, understand its structure, and create detailed implementation plans, but I cannot modify any files.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you plan today? I can:\n- Explore the current codebase structure\n- Analyze existing patterns and conventions\n- Design implementation approaches for new features\n- Create detailed step-by-step implementation plans\n- Identify critical files and dependencies\n\nJust provide me with your requirements and any perspective you'd like me to apply, and I'll thoroughly explore and plan the solution!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1123,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1123,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWH8ngTL6XjW4Yr5veywr","type":"assistant","uuid":"dc14a918-ff36-48f9-af5b-41a7098f5023","timestamp":"2025-12-20T02:17:00.078Z"}
