findings:
  successes:
    - "Successfully created a Fedora-based Docker container with lorax installed"
    - "Automatically detected and adapted to ARM64 (aarch64) architecture"
    - "Built a fully bootable Fedora 41 installation ISO (1.1GB)"
    - "Generated complete installation media including boot.iso, efiboot.img, and install.img"
    - "Lorax downloaded and installed 874 packages for the installation environment"
    - "Build completed successfully in approximately 7 minutes"
  failures:
    - "Initial attempt failed due to architecture-specific package names (x86_64 vs aarch64)"
    - "Output directory mount point issue required path restructuring"
    - "MD5 checksum implanting failed (application data conflict), though verification passed"
  lessons:
    - "Lorax is a powerful tool that can successfully build Fedora installation media"
    - "Architecture detection and adaptation is critical for cross-platform builds"
    - "Lorax requires the output directory to not exist before execution"
    - "Running in privileged Docker container is necessary for lorax operations"
    - "The tool successfully handles package resolution, dependency management, and bootloader configuration"
    - "ARM64 Fedora builds are fully supported by lorax"
