findings:
  successes:
    - "Docker environment created and verified successfully"
    - "Binutils Pass 1 compiled and installed correctly"
    - "GCC Pass 1 compiled successfully (15-30+ minutes)"
    - "Linux API Headers installed despite QEMU tar extraction issues"
    - "Handled cross-platform build (ARM64 Mac to AMD64 Linux)"
    - "Recovered from GNU FTP server issues by using mirrors"
    - "Maintained context and progress tracking across 3-4 hour session"
    - "Systematic approach to 150-step task was effective"
  failures:
    - "Initial package downloads failed due to ftp.gnu.org connectivity"
    - "QEMU emulation caused tar extraction errors (critical blocker)"
    - "Glibc build timed out (likely due to emulation overhead)"
  blockers:
    - "QEMU user-mode emulation instability with tar extraction"
    - "Cross-platform builds introduce 2-3x slowdown and reliability issues"
    - "Multi-hour builds on emulated platform not sustainable for 92 remaining packages"
  lessons:
    - "Infrastructure limitations can block progress before agent capability limits"
    - "Extreme-difficulty tasks (100+ steps) require native execution environments"
    - "LFS requires long build times (GCC alone 15-30+ minutes, full build 6-12 hours)"
    - "Network reliability is a key failure point for package downloads"
    - "Cross-platform Docker builds work initially but fail at scale"
    - "Agent successfully handled long-running processes and maintained context"
    - "Incremental progress tracking with persistent volumes was essential"
    - "Error recovery and adaptation strategies were effective within constraints"
