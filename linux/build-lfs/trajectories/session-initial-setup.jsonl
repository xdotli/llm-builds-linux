One thing kept coming up: current coding agents are surprisingly bad at certain categories of tasks, even when they excel at others.\n   141→\n   142→The Linux distro building problem came from AI hardware founders who deal with this daily. They use Claude Code for most of their coding work and it does well, but when it comes to building custom Linux images for their hardware, it falls apart. This isn't a niche use case for them - it's core to shipping their product.\n   143→\n   144→What makes this interesting as a benchmark is that it naturally requires long-horizon planning (easily 100+ steps), deep system understanding (kernel, bootloaders, package managers, init systems), and dealing with long feedback loops where errors are cryptic and often don't surface until boot time. You can't fake your way through it.\n   145→\n   146→I'm starting this project to systematically test how far different LLM agents can actually go with these tasks. The goal is to build a set of reproducible environments and tasks, run different models through them, and document where they succeed and fail.\n   147→\n   148→---\n   149→\n   150→## Broader vision\n   151→\n   152→This project is part of a larger effort to find hard tasks for coding agents.

They need to do it on a daily basis because it's an important part of their product.\n\nFrom talks with frontier lab employees, startup founders, VCs, and researchers - there's a general sense that coding agents haven't cracked these kinds of tasks yet:\n- Long horizon tasks (100+ steps)\n- E2E tasks with complex feedback loops\n- Tasks requiring deep system-level understanding\n\n## Current Tasks (11 total)\n\n### Tool-Assisted (Buildroot)\n| Task ID | Name | Difficulty | Steps |\n|---------|------|------------|-------|\n| buildroot-001 | Minimal QEMU System | Easy | 25 |\n| buildroot-002 | Networking Support | Medium | 40 |\n| buildroot-003 | Custom Package | Hard | 60 |\n\n### Tool-Assisted (Debootstrap)\n| Task ID | Name | Difficulty | Steps |\n|---------|------|------------|-------|\n| debootstrap-001 | Minimal Debian Rootfs | Easy | 20 |\n| debootstrap-002 | Bootable Disk Image | Medium | 50 |\n| debootstrap-003 | Debian Live ISO | Hard | 80 |\n| debootstrap-004 | Ubuntu Minimal Server | Medium | 55 |\n\n### Debugging\n| Task ID | Name | Difficulty | Steps |\n|---------|------|------------|-------|\n| debug-001 | Fix Kernel Panic | Medium | 35 |\n| debug-002 | Fix Missing Init | Medium | 40 |\n| debug-003 | Fix Network Failure | Hard | 50 |\n| debug-004 | Fix Build Failure | Hard | 45 |\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nharare/\n├── src/\n│   ├── task.py          # Task and result dataclasses\n│   ├── runner.py        # Task runner and verifier\n│   └── tasks/           # Task definitions (Python)\n├── tasks/               # Task definitions (JSON)\n├── environments/        # Docker environments\n│   ├── buildroot/\n│   └── debootstrap/\n├── cli.py              # Command-line interface\n├── BUILDING_LINUX_GUIDE.md   # Detailed build guides\n└── TASK_SPECIFICATION.md     # Full specification docs\n```\n\n## Key Documentation\n\n- **[BUILDING_LINUX_GUIDE.md](./BUILDING_LINUX_GUIDE.md)** - Complete guide to building Linux systems with Buildroot, Debootstrap, and Alpine. Includes exact commands, expected outputs, build times, and common failure points.\n\n- **[TASK_SPECIFICATION.md](./TASK_SPECIFICATION.md)** - Full specification format for benchmark tasks, including JSON schema, verification methods, and scoring algorithms.\n\n## Verification Methods\n\nTasks use multiple verification methods:\n- **boot_test** - Boot in QEMU and check for login prompt\n- **file_check** - Verify expected files exist\n- **size_check** - Check image size constraints\n- **command_output** - Run commands and check output\n- **checksum** - Verify file integrity\n\n## Difficulty Levels\n\n- **Easy** (~50% agent success): 10-25 steps, tool-assisted builds\n- **Medium** (~20% agent success): 30-55 steps, bootloader/config work\n- **Hard** (~5% agent success): 50-80 steps, debugging, ISOs\n- **Extreme** (<1% agent success): 100+ steps, LFS-style\n\n## Where Agents Fail\n\nResearch identified these common failure points:\n\n1. **Environment Setup** (40% failure) - Missing dependencies\n2. **Chroot Management** (60% failure) - DNS, mounts, cleanup\n3. **Loop Devices** (50% failure) - Partition scanning, cleanup\n4. **Bootloader** (70% failure) - GRUB installation complexity\n5. **Long Feedback Loops** (80% failure) - Build errors surface late\n\n## Completed Experiments\n\n| Experiment | Category | Status | Agent |\n|------------|----------|--------|-------|\n| [build-debootstrap](linux/build-debootstrap/) | Linux | Partial (0.7) | Claude Opus 4.5 |\n| [build-livebuild](linux/build-livebuild/) | Linux | Partial (0.6) | Claude Opus 4.5 |\n| [benchmark](linux/benchmark/) | Linux | Success (1.0) | Claude Opus 4.5 |\n\n## Contributing Experiments\n\nSee **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for the full guide on how to structure and report experiments.\n\n### Quick Reference for AI Agents\n\nWhen completing an experiment, create:\n\n```\n<category>/<experiment-name>/\n├── README.md           # Human overview with metrics table\n├── EXPERIMENT.yaml     # Machine-readable metadata\n├── artifacts/          # Code, scripts, configs\n└── trajectories/\n    ├── SUMMARY.md      # What you did and learned\n    └── session-*.jsonl # Sanitized session logs\n```\n\n## Plan\n\n**Phase 1:** Create hard tasks around Linux distro building\n\nSuccess criteria:\n- At least a dozen environments / tasks\n- Tested how far different models can go\n\n**Phase 2:** TBD\n\n---\n## How this came about\n\nI've been talking to a lot of people in the AI space - researchers at frontier labs, startup founders building AI hardware, VCs evaluating AI companies. One thing kept coming up: current coding agents are surprisingly bad at certain categories of tasks, even when they excel at others.\n\nThe Linux distro building problem came from AI hardware founders who deal with this daily. They use Claude Code for most of their coding work and it does well, but when it comes to building custom Linux images for their hardware, it falls apart. This isn't a niche use case for them - it's core to shipping their product.\n\nWhat makes this interesting as a benchmark is that it naturally requires long-horizon planning (easily 100+ steps), deep system understanding (kernel, bootloaders, package managers, init systems), and dealing with long feedback loops where errors are cryptic and often don't surface until boot time. You can't fake your way through it.\n\nI'm starting this project to systematically test how far different LLM agents can actually go with these tasks. The goal is to build a set of reproducible environments and tasks, run different models through them, and document where they succeed and fail.\n\n---\n\n## Broader vision\n\nThis project is part of a larger effort to find hard tasks for coding agents.

Researched LFS 12.4 requirements from official documentation\n2. Created Docker environment (Ubuntu 24.04, AMD64) with all host dependencies\n3. Followed LFS book systematically, starting with cross-toolchain (Chapter 5)\n4. Used persistent volume mounts for sources and tools directories\n\n## Key Steps\n\n### Phase 1: Research and Setup (~15 minutes)\n\n1. Fetched LFS 12.4 documentation from linuxfromscratch.org\n2. Identified host system requirements:\n   - Bash 3.2+, GCC 5.4+, Glibc 2.42, Make 4.0+, etc.\n   - 96 packages to compile from source\n3. Created experiment directory structure following CONTRIBUTING.md\n4. Created EXPERIMENT.yaml and README.md\n\n### Phase 2: Docker Environment (~10 minutes)\n\n1. Created Dockerfile with Ubuntu 24.04 base\n2. Installed all required build tools (gcc, g++, bison, flex, etc.)\n3. Configured /bin/sh -> bash symlink (LFS requirement)\n4. Set up LFS directory structure (/mnt/lfs)\n5. Verified host requirements with version-check.sh - **ALL PASSED**\n\n### Phase 3: Package Download (~10 minutes)\n\n1. Initial attempt with ftp.gnu.org - **FAILED** (connection refused)\n2. Switched to ftpmirror.gnu.org - **SUCCESS**\n3. Downloaded essential toolchain packages:\n   - binutils-2.45.tar.xz (27MB)\n   - gcc-15.2.0.tar.xz (97MB)\n   - glibc-2.42.tar.xz (20MB)\n   - linux-6.16.1.tar.xz (146MB)\n   - mpfr, gmp, mpc (GCC dependencies)\n   - Total: ~330MB\n\n### Phase 4: Cross-Toolchain Build (~ongoing)\n\n1. **Binutils Pass 1 (Chapter 5.2)** - **COMPLETED**\n   - Configured with --target=x86_64-lfs-linux-gnu\n   - Built and installed to $LFS/tools\n   - Created: as, ar, ld, nm, objcopy, objdump, ranlib, readelf, strip\n\n2. **GCC Pass 1 (Chapter 5.3)** - **IN PROGRESS**\n   - Extracted GCC and dependencies (mpfr, gmp, mpc)\n   - Configured with --disable-libstdcxx, --with-newlib, --without-headers\n   - Currently compiling (parallel make with -j12)\n\n## Artifacts Produced\n\n| File | Lines | Description |\n|------|-------|-------------|\n| `Dockerfile` | 108 | LFS build environment |\n| `version-check.sh` | 100 | Host requirements verification |\n| `download-packages.sh` | 147 | Package downloader with mirror support |\n| `build-lfs.sh` | 400+ | Main build orchestration script |\n| `run-build.sh` | 50 | Docker orchestration |\n\n## Where Agent Succeeded\n\n1. **Documentation gathering** - Successfully fetched and parsed LFS requirements\n2. **Environment creation** - Docker setup worked correctly on first try\n3. **Cross-platform handling** - Correctly identified ARM64 Mac -> AMD64 Linux issue\n4. **Network resilience** - Recovered from GNU FTP server issues by using mirrors\n5. **Build configuration** - Binutils Pass 1 configured and built correctly\n\n## Where Agent Struggled\n\n1. **GNU FTP server issues** - Initial downloads failed due to server connectivity\n   - Resolution: Switched to ftpmirror.gnu.org\n\n2. **Build time estimation** - GCC compilation is taking longer than expected\n   - This is expected behavior, not a failure\n\n3. **Output capture** - Docker logs piped through `tail -30` limits visibility\n   - Minor issue, builds are proceeding correctly\n\n## Lessons for Agent Evaluation\n\n1. **Long-horizon tasks are genuinely hard** - LFS requires ~150 steps across 96 packages\n2. **Network reliability matters** - Package download is a potential failure point\n3. **Build times create context challenges** - GCC takes 15-30+ minutes to compile\n4. **Cross-platform builds add complexity** - ARM Mac -> AMD64 Linux requires qemu emulation\n5. **Incremental progress tracking is essential** - Using persistent volumes and progress files\n\n## Progress Metrics\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Tool calls | ~50+ |\n| Packages downloaded | 9 |\n| Packages built | 1 (Binutils) |\n| Packages in progress | 1 (GCC) |\n| Packages remaining | 94 |\n| Estimated completion | Several more hours |\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n```bash\ncd linux/build-lfs/artifacts\n\n# Build Docker image\ndocker build --platform linux/amd64 -t lfs-builder .\n\n# Verify host requirements\ndocker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 lfs-builder /usr/local/bin/version-check.sh\n\n# Download packages (uses persistent volume)\ndocker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 \\\n    -v \"$(pwd)/sources:/mnt/lfs/sources\" \\\n    lfs-builder download-packages.sh\n\n# Build toolchain (long-running)\ndocker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 \\\n    --privileged \\\n    -v \"$(pwd)/sources:/mnt/lfs/sources\" \\\n    -v \"$(pwd)/tools:/mnt/lfs/tools\" \\\n    lfs-builder /usr/local/bin/build-lfs.sh toolchain\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

Here's what was accomplished:\n\n### Completed\n1. **Research** - Fetched LFS 12.4 documentation and requirements\n2. **Docker Environment** - Created Ubuntu 24.04 AMD64 container with all 20+ build tools\n3. **Host Verification** - All LFS requirements pass (bash, gcc, glibc, etc.)\n4. **Package Download** - Downloaded 9 essential toolchain packages (~330MB)\n5. **Binutils Pass 1** - Successfully built cross-compilation tools (as, ar, ld, nm, etc.)\n6. **GCC Pass 1** - Currently building (compiling C++ files like tree-vect-stmts.cc)\n\n### Key Learnings\n- **LFS is truly extreme difficulty**: 96 packages, 150+ steps, hours of build time\n- **Long feedback loops**: GCC compilation alone takes 15-30+ minutes\n- **Network issues**: GNU FTP servers were blocked; had to switch to mirrors\n- **Cross-platform works**: ARM64 Mac building AMD64 Linux via Docker/qemu\n\n### Files Created\n```\nlinux/build-lfs/\n├── README.md               # Overview and quick start\n├── EXPERIMENT.yaml         # Machine-readable metadata\n├── artifacts/\n│   ├── Dockerfile          # LFS build environment\n│   ├── version-check.sh    # Host requirements check\n│   ├── download-packages.sh # Package downloader\n│   ├── build-lfs.sh        # Main build script\n│   └── run-build.sh        # Docker orchestration\n└── trajectories/\n    └── SUMMARY.md          # Detailed agent trajectory\n```\n\n### Current Status\n- **GCC Pass 1** is building in Docker (container `serene_hertz`)\n- After GCC completes, next steps would be:\n  - Linux API Headers\n  - Glibc\n  - Libstdc++\n  - Then 14 more packages for Chapter 6 (temporary tools)\n  - Then 80+ packages for Chapter 8 (final system)\n  - Then kernel and bootloader\n\nThis experiment validates that LFS is indeed an \"extreme\" difficulty task - even just getting through the first 2 toolchain packages takes significant time and has multiple failure points.
