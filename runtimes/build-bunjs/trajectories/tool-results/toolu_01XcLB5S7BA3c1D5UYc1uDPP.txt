# Information About Building Bun

Based on my review of the provided web page content, **there is no information about building Bun, compilation requirements, challenges, or technical details related to Bun**.

The page contains details about the **Linux Plumbers Conference 2025**, specifically a Birds of a Feather (BoF) session focused on **Syzbot** — a continuous kernel fuzzing system for uncovering Linux kernel vulnerabilities. 

The session discusses:
- Syzbot's automated bug reporting capabilities
- Debugging kernel issues
- Maintainer workflows for handling syzbot reports
- Contributing to syzkaller (the fuzzing framework)

Bun is not mentioned anywhere on this page.
