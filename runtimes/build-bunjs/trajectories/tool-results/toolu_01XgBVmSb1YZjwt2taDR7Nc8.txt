Based on my search results, here's what I found about building the Bun JavaScript runtime from source:

## Building Bun from Source - Compilation Guide

### Overview
Bun is written in Zig and powered by JavaScriptCore under the hood, dramatically reducing startup times and memory usage.

### Prerequisites and System Requirements

Configuring a development environment for Bun can take 10-30 minutes depending on your internet connection and computer speed. You will need ~10GB of free disk space for the repository and build artifacts.

### Installing Dependencies

Using your system's package manager, install Bun's dependencies:

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install automake ccache cmake coreutils gnu-sed go icu4c libiconv libtool ninja pkg-config rust ruby
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install curl wget lsb-release software-properties-common cargo ccache cmake git golang libtool ninja-build pkg-config rustc ruby-full xz-utils
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel ccache cmake git go libiconv libtool make ninja pkg-config python rust sed unzip ruby
```

**Fedora:**
```bash
sudo dnf install cargo ccache cmake git golang libtool ninja-build pkg-config rustc ruby libatomic-static libstdc++-static sed unzip which libicu-devel 'perl(Math::BigInt)'
```

### LLVM Requirement
Bun requires LLVM 19 (clang is part of LLVM). This version requirement is to match WebKit (precompiled), as mismatching versions will cause memory allocation failures at runtime.

### Using Nix (Alternative)
A Nix flake is provided as an alternative to manual dependency installation. This provides all dependencies in an isolated, reproducible environment without requiring sudo.

### Build Cache with sccache
The version in your package manager may not have S3 support. You can install sccache with S3 support via `cargo install sccache --features=s3`. Build scripts will automatically detect and use sccache with the shared S3 cache.

### Building Bun
The `bd` package.json script compiles and runs a debug build of Bun, only printing the output of the build process if it fails. Bun generally takes about 2.5 minutes to compile a debug build when there are Zig changes.

### Important Note on Bootstrapping
It's not actually possible to build Bun if you don't possess a bun binary already, because it is used in the build process for code generation.(no content)You'll need Zig to compile, then JavaScriptCore and all its dependencies ready on the system. If you want to follow all the steps yourself, check how the dev container is built in the Dockerfile.devcontainer file in the repository.

### Building WebKit/JSC Locally
WebKit is not cloned by default (to save time and disk space). To clone and build WebKit locally, you need to clone the WebKit repository and check out the specific commit hash specified in the cmake configuration.

### Debug vs Release Builds
AddressSanitizer helps find memory issues, and is enabled by default in debug builds of Bun on Linux and macOS. This includes the Zig code and all dependencies. To build a release build with Address Sanitizer, run: `bun run build:release:asan`.

### Testing PR Builds
To save you time spent building a release build locally, Bun provides a way to run release builds from pull requests. This is useful for manually testing changes in a release build before they are merged. You can use the bun-pr npm package via `bunx bun-pr <pr-number>`.
