  details:
    - "Initial build request message"
    - "Follow-up message to continue"
    - "Xcode installation (critical blocker - agent cannot install from App Store)"

findings:
  successes:
    - "Research phase found correct official documentation quickly"
    - "Systematic approach with todo list tracking"
    - "Background processes for long-running operations"
    - "State recovery between sessions"
    - "Build progress monitoring and completion detection"
    - "Successfully navigated 100+ step process"
  failures:
    - "Did not check if full Xcode was installed before starting (only checked xcode-select)"
    - "Did not verify macOS SDK version compatibility upfront"
    - "Did not estimate total disk space needed (source + build = ~43GB)"
  lessons:
    - "Environment dependencies (Xcode, SDKs) are major blockers for agents"
    - "Long-running builds (2-8 hours) require monitoring strategies"
    - "Disk space estimation critical (100GB+ total)"
    - "Component builds (is_component_build=true) faster than static builds"
    - "Disabling symbols (symbol_level=0) significantly reduces build time"
