One thing kept coming up: current coding agents are surprisingly bad at certain categories of tasks, even when they excel at others.\n    44→\n    45→The Linux distro building problem came from AI hardware founders who deal with this daily. They use Claude Code for most of their coding work and it does well, but when it comes to building custom Linux images for their hardware, it falls apart. This isn't a niche use case for them - it's core to shipping their product.\n    46→\n    47→What makes this interesting as a benchmark is that it naturally requires long-horizon planning (easily 100+ steps), deep system understanding (kernel, bootloaders, package managers, init systems), and dealing with long feedback loops where errors are cryptic and often don't surface until boot time. You can't fake your way through it.\n    48→\n    49→I'm starting this project to systematically test how far different LLM agents can actually go with these tasks. The goal is to build a set of reproducible environments and tasks, run different models through them, and document where they succeed and fail.\n    50→\n    51→---\n    52→\n    53→## Broader vision\n    54→\n    55→This project is part of a larger effort to find hard tasks for coding agents.

They need to do it on a daily basis because it's an important part of their product.\n\nFrom talks with frontier lab employees, startup founders, VCs, and researchers - there's a general sense that coding agents haven't cracked these kinds of tasks yet:\n- Long horizon tasks (100+ steps)\n- E2E tasks with complex feedback loops\n- Tasks requiring deep system-level understanding\n\n## Task ideas\n\n- Build a minimal bootable Linux from scratch (LFS-style)\n- Create a custom Ubuntu/Fedora spin using live-build or lorax\n- Build embedded Linux with Yocto/Buildroot for specific hardware\n- Create a container-optimized minimal distro (like Alpine)\n- Fix a broken distro build\n\n## Tools agents would need\n\n- debootstrap, live-build (Debian/Ubuntu)\n- lorax, kickstart (Fedora/RHEL)\n- Yocto Project, Buildroot (embedded)\n- Docker/QEMU for testing builds\n\n## Plan\n\n**Phase 1:** Create hard tasks around Linux distro building\n\nSuccess criteria:\n- At least a dozen environments / tasks\n- Tested how far different models can go\n\n**Phase 2:** TBD\n\n---\n\n## How this came about\n\nI've been talking to a lot of people in the AI space - researchers at frontier labs, startup founders building AI hardware, VCs evaluating AI companies. One thing kept coming up: current coding agents are surprisingly bad at certain categories of tasks, even when they excel at others.\n\nThe Linux distro building problem came from AI hardware founders who deal with this daily. They use Claude Code for most of their coding work and it does well, but when it comes to building custom Linux images for their hardware, it falls apart. This isn't a niche use case for them - it's core to shipping their product.\n\nWhat makes this interesting as a benchmark is that it naturally requires long-horizon planning (easily 100+ steps), deep system understanding (kernel, bootloaders, package managers, init systems), and dealing with long feedback loops where errors are cryptic and often don't surface until boot time. You can't fake your way through it.\n\nI'm starting this project to systematically test how far different LLM agents can actually go with these tasks. The goal is to build a set of reproducible environments and tasks, run different models through them, and document where they succeed and fail.\n\n---\n\n## Broader vision\n\nThis project is part of a larger effort to find hard tasks for coding agents. The full notes are in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B1wgmJ1K4CZNMg7VWtUs-QsPAfCJ1mq7ggKO-lAby3U/edit).\n\nSome related ideas we're exploring:\n- 100 tasks that take agents 100 steps to solve (coding mostly)\n- Can agents build Chrome (and can they do follow up tasks)\n- Can agents build their own bun / rust cargo / openshift / kubernetes etc.\n- Given any repo / open-source repo and relevant keys / env vars, how far can agents go\n- Can agents build their own mobile OS\n- Inspection on which model is good at what (e.g. some models better at python, others at design)\n\nRelated work: [LLM Speedrunner](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llm-speedrunner) - a benchmark that lets AI build entire models.\n\n---\n\n## Experiment: Building Chromium\n\n### Status: Source fetched, blocked on Xcode\n\n**Date:** 2024-12-15\n\n### What was accomplished:\n\n1. **Set up depot_tools** (Google's build toolchain)\n   - Cloned from `https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git`\n\n2. **Fetched Chromium source** (~28GB)\n   - Used `fetch --no-history chromium` to skip git history\n   - Source located at `chromium/src/`\n\n3. **Created build configuration** (`chromium/src/out/Default/args.gn`)\n   ```\n   is_debug = false\n   is_component_build = true\n   symbol_level = 0\n   enable_nacl = false\n   ```\n\n4. **Created automated build script** (`build_chromium.sh`)\n\n### Blocker: Xcode Required\n\nBuilding Chromium for macOS requires full **Xcode** (not just Command Line Tools). The error:\n```\nxcode-select: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode, but active developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools instance\n```\n\n**To continue on macOS:**\n1. Install Xcode from App Store (~12GB)\n2. Run: `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`\n3. Accept license: `sudo xcodebuild -license accept`\n4. Run: `./build_chromium.sh`\n\n### Alternative: Build on Linux\n\nChromium builds more easily on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 recommended). The Linux build process doesn't require proprietary tools like Xcode.\n\n### Key learnings for agent evaluation:\n\n1. **Environment dependencies are a major blocker** - Chromium requires specific tools (Xcode, specific SDK versions) that agents cannot install on their own.\n\n2. **The fetch step is ~30 mins to hours** - Tests need to account for this.\n\n3. **~100GB disk space needed** - Source (~30GB) + build artifacts (~50-70GB).\n\n4. **Build time: 2-8 hours** on a modern machine.\n\n### Complexity assessment for agent benchmark:\n\n- **Steps involved:** ~50-100+ for a complete build\n- **Types of operations:** git operations, config file generation, dependency management, compilation\n- **Failure modes:** SDK mismatches, missing dependencies, config errors, compilation errors\n- **Feedback loop:** Long - errors may not appear until hours into the build\n","numLines":127,"startLine":1,"totalLines":127}}}

The README.md also documented what had been done previously:\n\n**From README.md (lines 71-93):**\n- depot_tools was cloned from `https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git`\n- Chromium source (~28GB) was fetched using `fetch --no-history chromium`\n- Source located at `chromium/src/`\n- Build configuration was created at `chromium/src/out/Default/args.gn`\n\nThe previous session was blocked on Xcode not being installed. When you asked me to continue, I checked and found:\n1. Xcode was now installed (`Xcode 26.2`)\n2. The source was already at `chromium/src/` \n3.

They need to do it on a daily basis because it's an important part of their product.\n\nFrom talks with frontier lab employees, startup founders, VCs, and researchers - there's a general sense that coding agents haven't cracked these kinds of tasks yet:\n- Long horizon tasks (100+ steps)\n- E2E tasks with complex feedback loops\n- Tasks requiring deep system-level understanding\n\n## Task ideas\n\n- Build a minimal bootable Linux from scratch (LFS-style)\n- Create a custom Ubuntu/Fedora spin using live-build or lorax\n- Build embedded Linux with Yocto/Buildroot for specific hardware\n- Create a container-optimized minimal distro (like Alpine)\n- Fix a broken distro build\n\n## Tools agents would need\n\n- debootstrap, live-build (Debian/Ubuntu)\n- lorax, kickstart (Fedora/RHEL)\n- Yocto Project, Buildroot (embedded)\n- Docker/QEMU for testing builds\n\n## Plan\n\n**Phase 1:** Create hard tasks around Linux distro building\n\nSuccess criteria:\n- At least a dozen environments / tasks\n- Tested how far different models can go\n\n**Phase 2:** TBD\n\n---\n\n## How this came about\n\nI've been talking to a lot of people in the AI space - researchers at frontier labs, startup founders building AI hardware, VCs evaluating AI companies. One thing kept coming up: current coding agents are surprisingly bad at certain categories of tasks, even when they excel at others.\n\nThe Linux distro building problem came from AI hardware founders who deal with this daily. They use Claude Code for most of their coding work and it does well, but when it comes to building custom Linux images for their hardware, it falls apart. This isn't a niche use case for them - it's core to shipping their product.\n\nWhat makes this interesting as a benchmark is that it naturally requires long-horizon planning (easily 100+ steps), deep system understanding (kernel, bootloaders, package managers, init systems), and dealing with long feedback loops where errors are cryptic and often don't surface until boot time. You can't fake your way through it.\n\nI'm starting this project to systematically test how far different LLM agents can actually go with these tasks. The goal is to build a set of reproducible environments and tasks, run different models through them, and document where they succeed and fail.\n\n---\n\n## Broader vision\n\nThis project is part of a larger effort to find hard tasks for coding agents. The full notes are in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B1wgmJ1K4CZNMg7VWtUs-QsPAfCJ1mq7ggKO-lAby3U/edit).\n\nSome related ideas we're exploring:\n- 100 tasks that take agents 100 steps to solve (coding mostly)\n- Can agents build Chrome (and can they do follow up tasks)\n- Can agents build their own bun / rust cargo / openshift / kubernetes etc.\n- Given any repo / open-source repo and relevant keys / env vars, how far can agents go\n- Can agents build their own mobile OS\n- Inspection on which model is good at what (e.g. some models better at python, others at design)\n\nRelated work: [LLM Speedrunner](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llm-speedrunner) - a benchmark that lets AI build entire models.\n\n---\n\n## Experiment: Building Chromium\n\n### Status: Source fetched, blocked on Xcode\n\n**Date:** 2024-12-15\n\n### What was accomplished:\n\n1. **Set up depot_tools** (Google's build toolchain)\n   - Cloned from `https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git`\n\n2. **Fetched Chromium source** (~28GB)\n   - Used `fetch --no-history chromium` to skip git history\n   - Source located at `chromium/src/`\n\n3. **Created build configuration** (`chromium/src/out/Default/args.gn`)\n   ```\n   is_debug = false\n   is_component_build = true\n   symbol_level = 0\n   enable_nacl = false\n   ```\n\n4. **Created automated build script** (`build_chromium.sh`)\n\n### Blocker: Xcode Required\n\nBuilding Chromium for macOS requires full **Xcode** (not just Command Line Tools). The error:\n```\nxcode-select: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode, but active developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools instance\n```\n\n**To continue on macOS:**\n1. Install Xcode from App Store (~12GB)\n2. Run: `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`\n3. Accept license: `sudo xcodebuild -license accept`\n4. Run: `./build_chromium.sh`\n\n### Alternative: Build on Linux\n\nChromium builds more easily on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 recommended).

If you copy it using macOS's \\\"Shared Folder\\\" feature and Finder, Chromium.app should be directly runnable.

Then build normally. If you are on an Arm Mac, your build will by default be an Arm build.\\n\\n### Target CPU Settings\\n\\n`target_cpu=\\\"x64\\\"` should be for 64-bit Intel/AMD chips, while `target_cpu=\\\"arm64\\\"` should give you a native binary for the M1/M2.\\n\\n### Building on ARM Macs\\n\\nIt's possible to build on an arm Mac without Rosetta.

If you copy it using macOS's \\\"Shared Folder\\\" feature and Finder, Chromium.app should be directly runnable.
